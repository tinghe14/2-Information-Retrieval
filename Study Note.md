Module 1: Boolean Retrieval

Information Retrieval:
- field concerned with the organization, storage, and retrieval of information for text, semistructured data(xml), video images and speech

Three major problems in IR:
- polysemy: words can have multiple meanings
- synonymy: the same concept can be expressed using different words
- morphology: many word forms are related and small affixed adjust meaning

Chapter 13 - Text Classification & Na√Øve Bayes
- before this chapters, this book has mainly discussed the process of as hoc retireval, where users have transient information needs that they try to address by posing one or more queries to a search engine. However, you might have ongoing information needs
  - standing query: a standing query is like any other query except that it is periodically executed on a colleciton to which new documents are incrementally added over time.
  - to caputre the generality and scope of the problem space to which standing queries belong, we now introduce the general notion of a classification problem.
  - classificatin using standing quries is also called routing or filtering.
- rules:
  - classification by the use of standing quries, which can be thought of as rules, most commonly wrriten by hand
    - example: 'multicore computer chips' can be set rules as '(multicore OR multi-core) AND (chip OR processor OR microprocessor)'
  - a rule caputres a certain combination of kwyworrds that indeicates class.
  - hand-coded rules have good scaling propoerties, but creating and maintaining them over time is labor intensive,
  - apart from manual classification and hand-crafed rules, there is a third approach to text classification, namely, machine learning-based text classficatin.
- statisitcal text classification:
  - labeling: the process of of annotating each document with its class
